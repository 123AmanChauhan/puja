            <h2>Significance of Ganesh Puja</h2>
            <p class="p3">There are so many legends around Lord Ganesha. The most fabled one is about how he got the elephant head.<br><br>

                Shiva was away, meditating on Mount Kailash and Parvati was left alone in Himalayas. Here she created a human form with her own skin upon her friend’s advice to have someone safeguard her. She named him Vinayaka and also breathed life into him. She instructed him to stand at the door and safeguard their home while she was inside.<br><br>
                
                When Shiva returned, Vinayaka confronted him and did not allow him to go inside. Shiva lost his cool and beheaded Vinayaka in a fit of rage. Parvati was left in despair after the incident. To console her, Shiva asked his Ganas to get the head of a first living creature with his head in north direction. The Ganas came back with the head of a baby elephant. Shiva joined the baby elephant’s head over Vinayaka's body with his divine powers and announced him the Head of the Ganas clan; hence, he came to be known as Ganesha.<br><br>
                
                To further assure Parvati, Shiva along with Lord Brahma’s consent announced that Ganesha would be ardently worshipped by one. He presented Ganesha with a boon that people will henceforth worship him before worshiping any other God or beginning any auspicious activity. Ganesha is also known for his intelligence and wisdom that removes the darkness around and provides enlightenment.</p>
